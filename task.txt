1) KBGA bug
2) Intersection vs normal accuracy difference

3) initial population change in knowledge base
4) crossover la, vera method use panni, should try to maintain the features count
5) mutation layum, should manage to maintain the features count = eg, flipping 1 to 0, then also, flip some other 0 bit to 1


6) clear doubt on, fitness function = X_train[:, features], is this the right method
7) doubt in, X_bow and C_bow = 
for population and train,etc X_bow is used [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,..]
for just the idf & tf, c_bow is used = [0,1,0,2,0,3,0,...] 
is this fine
