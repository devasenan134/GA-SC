1) KBGA bug
$$$ 2) Intersection vs normal accuracy difference

$$$ 3) initial population change in knowledge base 
$$$ 4) crossover la, vera method use panni, should try to maintain the features count
$$$ 5) mutation layum, should manage to maintain the features count = eg, flipping 1 to 0, then also, flip some other 0 bit to 1


$$$ 6) clear doubt on, fitness function = X_train[:, features], is this the right method

$$$ 7) mutation rate ah feature_count kuda multiply pannanum
$$$ 8)crossover - take the indexes of both parents, find a single point and perform crossover in case of any repeatation of index, just chnage it to any other random index for that child

$$$ 9) results analysis for GA to be done
$$$ 10) 100gen runs, other dataset runs

$$$ 11) pop_after_sel has to be copied to maintain the pop size


16/02/2023
$$$ 12) kbga with varient pressure - in the selection process
100 from ip, 80 from fitness, tfidf thresh form selection, crossover la parent 80+ child
$$$ 13) kbga with varient pressure - in the selection process, without kb in ps


$$$ 14) kbga_no_kbps 
$$$ 15) kbga-es50 - done and continue with 30runs
$$$ 16) kbga_with no mutation_prb and crossover_prb
$$$ 17) add child+parents and control pop to 80, after crossover tooo - to all types

18) correct the fluctuation of the kbga varients
$$$ 19) Comparison graph for 4 varients of kbga
$$$ 20) the best kbga, should to taken for comparison with GA
$$$ 21) save the pop size, in each step for all generations
$$$ 22) Intersection part to be done


24/02/2023
$$$ 23) es50 varient - try with 2 more versions = one should pass 100pop from mu to next generation
                                            = this should pass 160pop from mu to next generation
                                            choose the best one and apply it to all other varients
$$$ 24) still should work on the fluctuations

28/02/2023
$$$ 25) Run 5 runs for 2 types of ES50 and plot comparison
26) Do PT for GA on CO and MU probability, with 100 or 160 version
27) once pt is done, run 30 runs for 100, 150 and 200 fc for GA and all KBGA varients
