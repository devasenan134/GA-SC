1) KBGA bug
$$$ 2) Intersection vs normal accuracy difference

$$$ 3) initial population change in knowledge base 
$$$ 4) crossover la, vera method use panni, should try to maintain the features count
$$$ 5) mutation layum, should manage to maintain the features count = eg, flipping 1 to 0, then also, flip some other 0 bit to 1


$$$ 6) clear doubt on, fitness function = X_train[:, features], is this the right method

$$$ 7) mutation rate ah feature_count kuda multiply pannanum
$$$ 8)crossover - take the indexes of both parents, find a single point and perform crossover in case of any repeatation of index, just chnage it to any other random index for that child

9) results analysis for GA to be done
$$$ 10) 100gen runs, other dataset runs

11) pop_after_sel has to be copied to maintain the pop size
